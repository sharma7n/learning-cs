CHAPTER 3

INTRODUCTION TO LISTS

- List concept is not the list implementation

BASIC LIST IMPLEMENTATIONS

- Lists and arrays are both collections
- Arrays support direct access
	- Contiguous memory
	- Any element can be accessed as easily as any other element
	- AKA Random Access
	- Access is O(1)
	- Adding/removing elements is O(n)
	- Search is linear O(n) or binary if sorted O(log n)
- Lists support sequential access
	- Structure is NOT contiguous
	- Last node is either null or a sentinel node
	- Linked List
	- Access is O(n)
	- Adding/removing elements is O(1)
	- Search is only linear O(n)
	
SINGLY AND DOUBLY LINKED LISTS

- Singly only has next, doubly has next and prev
- Linked list can be circular
- Why is insert/remove easier in a doubly linked list than a singly linked list?

LIST LANGUAGE SUPPORT

- Python lists are arrays, so have direct access.

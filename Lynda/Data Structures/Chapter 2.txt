CHAPTER 2

RESIZABLE ARRAYS

- Java: basic array is fixed size, use ArrayList for resizable
- Objective C: Has basic array, NSArray, and NSMutableArray
- Where to add the new element?
- Re-indexing can have a performance impact
- "Push" is a common term for adding an object to the end of a data structure
- "Pop" is to remove an element from the end of a data structure

- Five requirements of any data structure
	- How to access (one / all items)
	- How to insert (at end or position)
	- How to delete (from end or position)
	- How to find (if exists or get location)
	- How to sort (sort in place or create sorted version)
	
SORTING ARRAYS

- Sort can be expensive

SORTING CUSTOM OBJECTS

- Provide comparator

SEARCHING ARRAYS

- Linear/sequential search checks each element, O(n)
- There is no data structure that's best in ALL situations

USING BUILT-IN SEARCH BEHAVIOR

- Typically "contains" for exists and "indexOf" for position
- Might be doing a lot of work

USING BINARY SEARCHING

- Can be done if the array is ascending/descending order
- AKA half-interval, divide and conquer
- Look at the documentation and see if the language offers linear search by default, use binary search when possible.

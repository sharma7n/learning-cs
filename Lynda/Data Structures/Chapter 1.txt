CHAPTER 1

WHAT IS A DATA STRUCTURE?

- Some ordered arrangement of data
- Real world data structures: recipes, shopping list, flight schedule, etc.
- Definition: An intentional arrangement of data.
- Focus: Data structures created and held in memory during a program run.

DESCRIBING SIMPLE DATA STRUCTURE

- A "record" is the generic term for a group of related data (i.e., "Tuple")
- A "field" is one specific piece of data in a record

USING C-STYLE STRUCTS

- "Struct" is a keyword in C
- struct Book { ... }
- Book first
- first.title = "foo"
- Difference from classes:
	- Only data. Classes also have behavior (methods)
	- Simple creation vs. explicit instantiation
	- Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference
	- No OO features vs. Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc.
	
- Good example: (x, y) point on a screen
- Do not exist in Python, but you can fake it.

BASIC ARRAYS

- Most fundamental data structure
- Ordered collection of item
- Zero-based index
- Fixed size (immutable)
- Specific data type
- The more constraints you can put in place on a data structure, the smaller and faster it will be

MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS

- Usually array of arrays

JAGGED ARRAYS

- Array of arrays where the sub-arrays have different lengths

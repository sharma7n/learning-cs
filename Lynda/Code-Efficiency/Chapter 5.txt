CHAPTER 5: Network Efficiency

- Minimize (repeated amounts of) network latency
- Check development tools in network
- Distance affects latency
- "Chunky, not chatty" (i.e., minimize NewRecordSet)
- Use CDN (CloudFront, EdgeCast, etc.)
- Compress information

Database Efficiency

- Begin with normalization - later denormalize for performance
- Measure with query and index analysis tools

Next steps

- Web app (server side)
	- Caching
	- Find platform best practices
- Client side
	- Run through Google PageSpeed
- Mobile apps
	- Learn language collection types
	- Learn the profiler
- Desktop apps
	- Improve startup
	- Better use of multithreading of UI
	
Conclusion

- First, do nothing
- You don't know the problem until you measure it
- Understand what's under your control
- Always look for easy win
